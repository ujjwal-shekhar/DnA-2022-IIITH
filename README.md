The follow commands have been demonstrated in the video attached titled '38.mp4', in this very order

### Query 1
This is a function to satisfy one of the INSERT functional requirements.
We ask the user to enter relevant data about the new villager. This function would be useful when a new villager comes to reside in the village, or some villager has just turned 18 etc, and their details need to be fed into the database.
```
"""INSERT INTO Villagers
(Aadhar_No, Pan_No, Name, Caste_or_Sect, Sex, Age, Phone_No, Literacy, Occupation)
VALUES('%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%d', '%d', '%s', '%s')""" % (
row["AADHAR"], row["PAN"], row["Name"], row["Caste"], row["Sex"], \
row["Age"], row["Phone"], row["Literacy"], row["Occupation"]);"""
```
### Query 2
This is a function to satisfy one of the DELETE functional requirements
We ask the user to enter relevant information about the small business  whose data is to be deleted. This function could come up if a business goes down or is shut down by its owner.
```
"""DELETE FROM `Small_Businesses`
WHERE Aadhar_No = '%s' AND Name = '%s'""" % (row["AADHAR"], row["Name"]);"""
```
### Query 3
This is a function to satisfy one of the UPDATE functional requirements
We update the number of employees of the business whose relevant data is provided by the user. This function would be useful if some business hires new staff
```
"""UPDATE `Small_Businesses`
SET No_of_employees = '%d'
WHERE Aadhar_No = '%s' AND Name = '%s'""" %(
row["No_of_employees"], row["AADHAR"], row["Name"]);"""
```
### Query 4
We calculate the average age of all villagers. The average age of a demography is strongly correlated to its working force. A smaller value would indicate that the village populace is younger on average, and hence is more capable of working.
```
"""SELECT AVG(Age) AS 'Average Age'
FROM Villagers""";
```
### Query 5
We get all relevant information about all events that had been held for the purpose of vaccination. This would help the Panchayat analyze how well protected the people are. As the number of vaccinations increase, the rate of people falling ill, and hence being off of work decreases.
```
"""SELECT * FROM Events
WHERE Purpose LIKE '%Vaccination%'""";
```
### Query 6
We get the information of all villagers who work as nurses. The Panchayat would like to know how many nurses its village has. This helps them know how well prepared the village is to handle any medical crisis.
```
"""SELECT Aadhar_No, Name, Age, Sex, Phone_No
FROM Villagers
WHERE Occupation
LIKE '%Nurse%'""";
```
### Query 7
People who own extremely large farms will be responsible for the majority of the economy that is generated by farming. Hence, the Panchayat would like to know such farmlands and their owners
```
"""SELECT Villagers.Aadhar_No AS 'AADHAR No.',
Farmlands.Serial_No AS 'Farmland No',
Villagers.Name AS 'Owner Name',
Farmlands.Area AS 'Land Size'
FROM Villagers INNER JOIN Farmlands
ON Farmlands.Aadhar_No = Villagers.Aadhar_No
WHERE Farmlands.Area >= '%d';"""%(LARGE_FARM_CUTOFF)
```
### Query 8
We wish to list the average income of each caste. Such analysis become extremely important when the Panchayat wishes to analyze if there is any sort of discrimination or special challenges that a particular section of the society is facing
```
"""SELECT Villagers.Caste_or_Sect AS 'Caste',
AVG(Taxation.Total_Income) AS 'Average Income'
FROM Villagers, Taxation
WHERE Villagers.Aadhar_No = Taxation.Aadhar_No
GROUP BY Villagers.Caste_or_Sect;"""

```
### Query 9
We wish to get the number of people belonging to each age group. If the standard deviation of the age distribution is extremely small, it becomes more important that the Panchayat has information about the number of people belonging to a particular age group

```
"""SELECT Govt_Schemes.Which AS 'Scheme Name',
Govt_Schemes.Since_When AS 'Time since in effect',
Govt_Schemes.Benefits_Provided AS 'Benefits',
Villagers.Name AS 'Beneficiary Name'
FROM Govt_Schemes INNER JOIN Villagers ON
Villagers.Aadhar_No = Govt_Schemes.Aadhar_No
WHERE Govt_Schemes.Which LIKE '%MGNREGA%';"""
```
### Query 10
We wish to list all Panchayat members who own farmlands too large. If some Panchayat members own huge properties, this may hint towards ongoing corruption.
```
"""
SELECT
Panchayat_Members.Aadhar_No AS 'AADHAR INFO',
Villagers.Name AS 'Panchayat Member Name',
Panchayat_Members.Salary AS 'Salary',
Panchayat_Members.Years_Of_Service AS 'Years of Service',
Tax_Waivers.Tax_Waiver AS 'Tax Waiver Recieved',
Farmlands.Area AS 'Farmland Area'
FROM Panchayat_Members, Villagers, Farmlands, Tax_Waivers, Taxation
WHERE
Panchayat_Members.Aadhar_No = Villagers.Aadhar_No
AND Panchayat_Members.Aadhar_No = Taxation.Aadhar_No
AND Taxation.ITR_No = Tax_Waivers.ITR_No
AND Farmlands.Aadhar_No = Panchayat_Members.Aadhar_No
AND Farmlands.Area >= 1000;
"""
```
### Query 11
We wish to list the number of women above the age of 30 who are currently employed. Ensuring the women of the village have employment is one of the fundamental duties of the Panchayat, and hence it requires the relevant information about the percentage of women in the workforce
```
"""
SELECT
Villagers.Name AS Name,
Villagers.Age AS Age,
Taxation.Total_Income AS 'Current Income'
FROM Villagers, Taxation
WHERE
Villagers.Aadhar_No = Taxation.Aadhar_No AND
Taxation.Total_Income <> 0 AND
Villagers.Sex = 'Female' AND
Villagers.Age > 30;

"""

```
### Query 12
We wish to list details of people with names starting with "A" and are in the top 30% of tax payers. This may be useful for some specific logistical analysis
```

```
### Query 13
We wish to determine all the villagers who did not cast their vote in the elections. Ensuring voting percentage is high as possible is a matter of interest to the Panchayat and hence it would like to be informed about the people who do not actively vote
```
"""
SELECT
Villagers.Aadhar_No AS `Non-Voter AADHAR NUMBER`,
Villagers.Name AS `Non-Voter Name`
FROM Villagers
WHERE
Villagers.Aadhar_No NOT IN (
SELECT Elect.Villager_Aadhar_No
FROM Elect
);
"""
```
### Query 14
We wish to know the Panchayat Member who has the highest salary.  This would the Panchayat know what the distribution of wages is amongst themselves
```
"""
SELECT
Villagers.Name AS Name,
Panchayat_Members.Salary AS Salary
FROM Villagers, Panchayat_Members
WHERE
Villagers.Aadhar_No = Panchayat_Members.Aadhar_No
ORDER BY Panchayat_Members.Salary DESC LIMIT 1;
"""
```
